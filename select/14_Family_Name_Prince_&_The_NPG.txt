We found this tape in the Akashic records
This is Thomas Jefferson
My fellow Americans, yes I own slaves too
And if there is a just God
We're going to pay for this
Black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles
Protestants and Catholics
We'll be able to join hands in the words of the old Negro spiritual
Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are free at last
