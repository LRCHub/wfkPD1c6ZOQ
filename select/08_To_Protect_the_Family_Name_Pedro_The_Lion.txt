Officer
Please don't haul me in
Though I'm drunk again
I can explain
I swear to you
For a week I have
Been completely dry
Until tonight

He's been such a good example
Everything he's done for me
I couldn't bear to let him down

Monday night
Brother sat me down
Very graciously
And explained
"If I'm going to help you
I must make it very clear
Brother that I love you
But certainly I hate your sin"

So you see you can't arrest me
I swore I'd be careful not to
Further shame the family name
